<h2 id="reopening-california">Reopening California<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>California is moving Beyond the Blueprint to safely and fully reopen the economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of June 15, 2021, the Governor terminated the executive orders that put into place the <strong>Stay Home Order </strong>and the <strong>Blueprint for a Safer Economy</strong>. He also phased out the vast majority of executive actions put in place since March 2020 as part of the pandemic response, leaving a subset of provisions that facilitate the ongoing recovery.</p>

<p>The new <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Beyond-Blueprint.aspx">public health order</a> effective June 15 supersedes all prior health orders. The order has limited restrictions, only related to masking and mega-events, as well as settings serving children and youth pending an expected update to the K-12 schools guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<h3>Restrictions that <strong>ended</strong> on June 15 include:</h3>

<ul><li>Physical distancing</li><li>Capacity limits on businesses</li><li>County tier system</li></ul>

<h2 id="continuing-safety-measures">Continuing safety measures</h2>

<p>Everyday life will feel a lot like before COVID-19. But reopening safely means continuing vaccinations and protecting the health and well-being of Californians.</p>

<h3>Do’s and don’ts for daily life</h3>

<p>Restaurants, shopping malls, movie theaters, and most everyday places will be open as normal with no capacity limits or social distancing required. Protect yourself and others by keeping these common-sense rules in mind.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Do</td><td>Don&#8217;t</td></tr><tr><td>✔️ Wear a mask if you’re unvaccinated, especially in crowded, indoor environments</td><td>❌ Expect others to be ready to shake hands or hug</td></tr><tr><td>✔️ Follow safety rules for mega-events</td><td>❌ Lose your proof of vaccination</td></tr><tr><td>✔️ Get tested if you’re sick</td><td>❌ Think you can’t get the virus or pass it on because you feel well</td></tr><tr><td>✔️ Wear a mask while on public transit, even if you&#8217;re vaccinated</td><td>❌ Assume everyone is vaccinated</td></tr><tr><td>✔️ Honor mask and distancing rules in place at a private business</td><td>❌ Expect all COVID-19 rules everywhere to be lifted</td></tr><tr><td>✔️ Get tested if required by your workplace</td><td>❌ Travel into the U.S. without proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test</td></tr><tr><td>✔️ Wear a mask when you travel</td><td>❌ Travel if you’re sick </td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h3 id="mask-guidance">Masks</h3>

<p>California’s Department of Public Health<strong> </strong>has updated statewide masking guidance to match the CDC’s guidance, lifting California’s mask requirements for vaccinated individuals starting on June 15. Vaccinated people are able to come together without masks in most circumstances.</p>

<p>People who are unvaccinated must continue to wear a mask indoors in public settings to protect themselves and others. Also, there are some settings where masking is still required for everyone, such as:</p>

<ul><li>Public transit</li><li>Hospitals</li><li>Long-term care facilities</li><li>Homeless shelters</li><li>Indoors in K-12 schools, childcare, and other youth settings&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>See CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">Guidance for the Use of Face Coverings</a> to learn where masks are recommended or may be required.</p>

<h3 id="travel">Travel</h3>

<p>California no longer has a travel advisory in effect. There is now no state recommendation to test and quarantine before and after travel.</p>

<p>However, CDC travel requirements are still in effect:</p>

<ul><li>All air passengers to the U.S. are required to have a negative COVID-19 test result or documentation of recovery before they can board a flight to the United States.</li><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/face-masks-public-transportation.html">Masks are required</a> on all forms of public transportation to and within the U.S. This includes planes, buses, trains, boats, and where you board them.</li></ul>

<p>Get tested if you feel sick, and avoid traveling if you have or may have COVID-19.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html">CDC’s travel guidelines</a>.</p>

<h3>K-12 schools, day camps, <strong>overnight camps,</strong> and childcare</h3>

<p>California continues to follow current COVID-19 public health <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19-K12-Schools-InPerson-Instruction.aspx">guidance for K-12 schools</a> until further updates from the CDC.  </p>

<p>Day camps and other supervised youth activities must follow these specific portions of the current K-12 schools guidance:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19-K12-Schools-InPerson-Instruction.aspx#Layers%20of%20Safety%3a%20Infection%20Mitigation%20Strategies">Layers of safety</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19-K12-Schools-InPerson-Instruction.aspx#What%20to%20do%20if%20there%20is%20a%20Confirmed%20or%20Suspected%20Case%20of%20COVID-19%20in%20a%20School">Confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case response</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19-K12-Schools-InPerson-Instruction.aspx#School%20Closure%20Determinations">Closures</a></li></ul>

<p>Day camps and other supervised youth activities may post the <a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.covid19.ca.gov%2Fpdf%2Fchecklist-daycamps--en.pdf&amp;data=04%7C01%7CNaomi.Bardach%40chhs.ca.gov%7Ce7ca7ef6c2d44e6a6ef908d92d0ef391%7C265c2dcd2a6e43aab2e826421a8c8526%7C0%7C0%7C637590365885606426%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=DG0%2BAK6daXW8b1ltCMpNrnF97W0cCl7jzc8Pdr35wuk%3D&amp;reserved=0">checklist for day camps and other supervised youth activities</a> in the facility.</p>

<p>The K-12 schools guidance does not apply to youth sports.</p>

<p>Current <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-childcare--en.pdf">guidance for childcare programs and providers</a> remains in effect.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Overnight-Camps.aspx">guidance for overnight camps</a> remains in effect through September 2021 unless otherwise indicated by CDPH.</p>

<h3>Mega-events</h3>

<p>Mega-events are indoor events with 5,000 or more people and outdoor events with 10,000 or more people. This includes events like:</p>

<ul><li>Conventions, conferences, and expos</li><li>Concerts, shows, and nightclubs</li><li>Sporting events</li><li>Live events and entertainment</li><li>Fairs, festivals, and parades</li><li>Theme parks, amusement parks, and water parks</li><li>Large private events or gatherings</li><li>Large races, marathons, and endurance events</li><li>Car shows</li></ul>

<h3 id="workplace-safety">Workplace safety</h3>

<p>There are no physical distancing or capacity limits for businesses and activities. Most businesses are required to maintain compliance with California’s <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">COVID-19 Prevention Emergency Temporary Standards</a> (ETS), which include current <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Guidance.aspx">public health guidelines</a>. Certain workplaces, like hospitals and correctional facilities, are required to comply with the <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/title8/5199.html">Aerosol Transmissible Diseases (ATD) standard</a> instead of the ETS.&nbsp;Find more details in the <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/COVID19FAQs.html">frequently asked questions</a> about the COVID-19 Prevention ETS. </p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center" id="county-map">County risk level map on June 15</h2>

<p>We provided this map as a measure of how our communities were doing against COVID-19 under the Blueprint framework. Every county in California was assigned to a tier based on its positivity rate, adjusted case rate, and/or health equity metric (applied to counties with populations more than 106,000).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>These metrics are no longer in effect.</strong> We provide this map for informational purposes only and as a means of comparing how our communities are doing with case rates and other measures, as compared to the metrics that were in effect under the Blueprint.</p>

<p>While county tiers are no longer associated with restricting activities, you can find the latest data about your county on the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/state-dashboard/">State Dashboard</a>.</p>
