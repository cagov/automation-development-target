<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I get my redemption code?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you get vaccinated on or after May 27, you’ll get a redemption code by text or email within 7-10 days after your last vaccination. For those receiving a two-dose series, your $50 card will be set aside until your completed second dose.</p>

<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you do not have a mobile phone or email address, then 7-10 days after your vaccination, you can call 1-833-993-3873 to receive a physical card.</li><li>If you don’t have a permanent address, then 7-10 days after your vaccination, call 1-833-993-3873 to coordinate delivery of your $50 card.</li></ul>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">How long after redeeming the incentive card does it take to receive it?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">It takes up to five business days to receive the incentive card. If you have not received your card after five business days, call 1-833-993-3873.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">How will people prove they’ve had both doses? What if someone tries to cheat with a fake vaccine card?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">COVID-19 vaccines are tracked in California immunization records. Incentive cards and other cash prizes will be awarded based on those records.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I got vaccinated, but did not receive my code?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you do not receive a code after 14 days, call 833-993-3873.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I get vaccinated outside of California’s My Turn system?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">You do not need to vaccinate through My Turn to be eligible. You are still eligible if your vaccination site is in California and reports doses given to the state.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I opted to not share my data with <strong>the Immunization Information System</strong>s (IIS)?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">The data is still reported to the state, so you would still be eligible for the incentive and other cash prizes.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is there a choice of incentive cards?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, there are three choices:</p>

<ol class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Virtual Mastercard®: Not an ATM card so it cannot be cashed out. It can be redeemed online where Debit Mastercard® is accepted. This is a virtual incentive card and can be added to a phone mobile wallet.</li><li>Kroger: Good at Ralphs, Food 4 Less and Foods Co. We recommend printing the card, as not all grocery stores can scan it on a phone.</li><li>Albertsons: Good at Safeway, Albertsons, Vons, Pavilions, and Andronico's Community Markets. We recommend printing the card, as not all grocery stores can scan it on a phone.</li></ol>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Available while supplies last. If you are younger than 18, you will need to have a parent or guardian complete the card selection process for you, unless you are an emancipated minor.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Does my redemption code ever expire?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. You must use the redemption code within 90 days to claim your card. Once claimed,&nbsp;the Virtual Mastercard® expires after 12 months. The grocery cards never expire.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Who pays for this program?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">This program is being paid for by the State of California.</p>
