<h2>Questions and answers</h2>

<p>For rules, eligibility, and more details, see <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Vax-Win-Terms.aspx">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

<h3>All drawings and incentives</h3>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What do I need to do to enter?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Just get vaccinated in California for COVID-19. No need to fill out an entry form. You are automatically entered in the drawing based on California immunization records once your vaccinator provides the state vaccination registry with your information. Vaccinations count whether you got the Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. You must be living in California to win. Winner gets the prize money after they complete their vaccination series.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I book a COVID-19 vaccination appointment?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can schedule appointments or find walk-in clinics at <a href="http://myturn.ca.gov">myturn.ca.gov</a>. You can also use other websites or hotlines provided by the CDC or local health departments. Appointments can also be made by calling the California COVID-19 Hotline at 1-833-422-4255.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I get vaccinated outside of California’s My Turn system?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">You do not need to vaccinate through My Turn to be eligible. You are still eligible if your vaccination site is in California and reports doses given to the state.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I opted to not share my data with <strong>the Immunization Information System</strong>s (IIS)?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">The data is still reported to the state, so you would still be eligible for the incentive and other cash prizes.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">How will winners be notified?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">The state protects your privacy, and has taken steps to protect Californians against scams. The winners will be notified by officials from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) through official "State of CA CDPH" caller ID, text, CDPH email address, or in person by CDPH district staff. Only CDPH knows the identity of the person associated with the random number that has been drawn. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Vax-Win-Terms.aspx">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Winners will not be asked to pay any fees associated with verifying eligibility for the cash prize. Any fraudulent activities or misinformation should be reported to <a href="mailto:rumors@cdph.ca.gov">rumors@cdph.ca.gov</a> or <a href="tel:833-993-3873">1-833-993-3873</a>. Individuals can use this email address or phone number to report any concerns about the authenticity of any contact they have received related to cash prizes.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will you make public the names of winners?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">At the time of the drawing, no names will be announced. Winners can decline the prize, or decline publicity associated with the prize.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Does a person need to be a U.S. citizen to win?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. Eligibility is not determined by immigration status. Those eligible to win must only meet the following criteria:</p>

<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Live in California,</li><li>Are aged 12 and older,</li><li>And have received at least a first dose of their COVID-19 vaccine.</li></ul>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Who is not eligible?</h4>

<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>An employee of certain government agencies or their immediate family member,&nbsp;</li><li>Incarcerated,</li><li>Live outside of California, or</li><li>Got vaccinated outside of California.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Prize money will be paid after the winner completes their vaccination series.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">I got a call about Vax for the Win that seemed fraudulent. What should I do?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Winners will be notified by the California Department of Public Health and will not be asked to pay any fees associated with verifying eligibility for the cash prize.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">The names of winners won't be disclosed without their consent. However, the county of the winner could be announced. The state will ensure the drawings are fair, honest, legal, and protective of personal information.</p>
