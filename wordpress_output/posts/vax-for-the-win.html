<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I got my first dose before the incentive card program started, then get my second dose after it started, am I eligible?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">No, you are not eligible to receive an incentive card. But you are eligible for the other cash prizes. The purpose of the card program is to motivate unvaccinated Californians to get vaccinated before the state fully reopens on June 15.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get the $50 incentive card if I completed my vaccination before the program started?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. The incentive card program is intended to motivate the remaining Californians to get vaccinated before the state fully reopens on June 15. However, fully vaccinated Californians are eligible for other cash prizes.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">How long after redeeming the incentive card does it take to receive it?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">It takes up to five business days to receive the incentive card. If you have not received your card after five business days, call 1-833-993-3873.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">How will people prove they’ve had both doses? What if someone tries to cheat with a fake vaccine card?</h4>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I opted to not share my data with <strong>the Immunization Information System</strong>s (IIS)?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">The data is still reported to the state, so you would still be eligible for the incentive and other cash prizes.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is there a choice of incentive cards?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, there are three choices:</p>

<ol class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Virtual Mastercard®: Not an ATM card so it cannot be cashed out. It can be redeemed online where Debit Mastercard® is accepted. This is a virtual incentive card and can be added to a phone mobile wallet.</li><li>Kroger: Good at Ralphs, Food 4 Less and Foods Co. We recommend printing the card, as not all grocery stores can scan it on a phone.</li><li>Albertsons: Good at Safeway, Albertsons, Vons, Pavilions, and Andronico's Community Markets. We recommend printing the card, as not all grocery stores can scan it on a phone.</li></ol>
