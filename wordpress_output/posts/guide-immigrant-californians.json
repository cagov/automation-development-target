You may be asked to verify your age to confirm you are 12 or older. You do not need state-issued ID or insurance to get the vaccine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get the vaccine for free no matter what your immigration or citizenship status is. Vaccinations <strong>do not</strong> count under the public charge rule. You should not be asked about your immigration or citizenship status when you get a COVID-19 vaccine. The federal government has confirmed they will not do immigration operations at or near vaccination sites and clinics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more about vaccines and how to get one at <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.vaccinateall58.com\">VaccinateALL58.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Testing and treatment</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>Do not let fear stop you from getting necessary help or treatment.</strong></strong> The effects of avoiding health care services can be serious. This will help keep you, your family, and your community healthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re undocumented or do not have insurance, you can still get needed COVID-19 testing and treatment at no cost. Medi-Cal care for COVID-19 testing or treatment <strong>does not</strong> count under the public charge rule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/\">Testing is available</a> to every Californian who needs it, including immigrants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-text-align-left\">Call Medi-Nurse if you&#8217;re uninsured or have Medi-Cal, but no regular doctor</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Medi-Nurse is a <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/Pages/DHCS-COVID%E2%80%9119-Medi-Nurse-Line.aspx\">free, 24/7 nurse advice line</a> available at <a href=\"tel:877‑409‑9052\">1‑877‑409‑9052</a>.

Instead, the public charge rule will be applied as defined in the 1999 Interim Field Guidance in place prior to the expanded public charge rule’s implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This change in federal policy means immigrants and their loved ones across California can seek and accept medical care, food assistance, and public housing without fear of or confusion about public charge consequences.
