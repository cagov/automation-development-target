Infected droplets are released when a person exhales,<strong> </strong>talks, coughs, sneezes, sings, exercises, or shouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Masks can reduce your exposure to infectious droplets through filtration.

The CDC has collected evidence on the <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html\">effectiveness of masks</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Masks create a barrier that helps prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the wearer coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\"><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html?fbclid=IwAR28PppCa6x2uxwO8Z2baHM0KHS4JXx0inzzMQs3zRHV1qql_0a8mxZfpCw\">A mask also offers some protection to you</a>. How well it protects you from breathing in the virus likely depends on the fabrics used and how your mask is made (the type of fabric, the number of layers of fabric, how well the mask fits).</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">You should wear a mask, even if you do not feel sick. This is because several studies have found that people with COVID-19 who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and those who are not yet showing symptoms (pre-symptomatic) can still spread the virus to other people. Wearing a mask helps protect those around you, in case you are infected but not showing symptoms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">It is especially important to wear a mask when you are indoors with people you do not live with and when you are unable to stay at least 6 feet apart since COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact\">close contact</a> with one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stay informed</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>CDPH: <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx\">Guidance for the Use of Face Coverings</a></li><li>CDC: <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/masks/mask-travel-guidance.html\">Wearing of face masks while on conveyances and at transportation hubs</a></li><li>CDC: <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html\">Use of Masks to Help Slow the Spread of COVID-19</a></li><li>CDC: <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html\">How to Select, Wear, and Clean Your Mask</a></li><li>CalOSHA: <a href=\"https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/Face-coverings-poster.pdf\">Face Coverings, Masks, and Respirators &#8211; When to Use Them to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19</a></li><li>Wear a mask: <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://toolkit.covid19.ca.gov/\">Images you can share on social media</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n"
