<h3 class="wp-accordion">What effect will late payments have on my credit report?</h3>

<h3 class="wp-accordion">How long will financial relief programs last?</h3>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">It’s unclear how severe or how long COVID-19 will affect California. Financial institutions have committed to necessary relief and will assess ongoing conditions and need for continuing relief.</p>

<h3 class="wp-accordion">What if my financial institution isn’t offering relief?</h3>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Call or check their website to be sure. At this time, JP Morgan Chase, US Bank, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, <a href="https://dbo.ca.gov/covid19-updates-fi/">and nearly 200 state-chartered banks</a> and credit unions are supporting commitments to relief.</p>
