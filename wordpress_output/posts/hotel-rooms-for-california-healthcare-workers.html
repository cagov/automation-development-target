<p class="emphasized">The Non-Congregate Sheltering (NCS) for California Healthcare Workers Program keeps California&#8217;s healthcare workers safe and healthy and reduces the spread of the COVID-19 virus. It provides free or discounted hotel rooms to healthcare workers who give critical care to COVID-19 patients so they do not bring home the virus to their household.</p>

<p class="blue-highlight">FEMA has approved this program for emergency, non-congregate sheltering. This program is a governmental effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. Under this program, eligible healthcare workers have a place to quarantine away from their household. This program has complete discretion in determining a participant’s eligibility and all aspects of the operation of the program. The program is not intended to create any rights or entitlement.</p>



<h3 id="discounted-rates"><strong><strong>Discounted hotel rates</strong></strong></h3>

<h2 id="questions-workers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">Can routine travel for healthcare staff be covered under the “Hotel rooms for healthcare workers” program?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. Lodging for traveling healthcare providers should be accounted for in their contract through a stipend or in their hourly rate. The “Hotels rooms for healthcare workers” program shouldn’t be used to pay for those costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Traveling healthcare workers can access discounts provided by the program, but need to pay for the room on their own.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">What if my facility’s Point of Contact rejects my reservation request?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you meet the program eligibility criteria, you can access discounts provided by the program, but will have to pay for the room on your own.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">If I work for a staffing agency or registry, who will my Point of Contact be?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Your Point of Contact is the one for the healthcare facility you are working for. Staffing agencies and registries are not authorized to designate a Point of Contact.</p>
