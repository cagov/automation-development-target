This is called <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/help-for-homeowners/learn-about-forbearance/\">forbearance</a>. You request forbearance from your mortgage servicer. Landlords with four properties or less can also request forbearance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn the steps to pause or reduce your mortgage payments at <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/help-for-homeowners/\">Help for homeowners</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your deadline to request forbearance depends on who backs your mortgage.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If your loan is backed by HUD/FHA, USDA, or VA, the deadline for requesting an initial forbearance is September 30, 2021.</li><li>If your loan is backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, there currently is not a deadline for requesting an initial forbearance.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If your mortgage is not federally backed, your servicer may offer similar forbearance options. If you are struggling to make your mortgage payments, your servicer must discuss relief options with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Your rights if you’re denied forbearance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your servicer denies your request for forbearance, they must provide you with:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A detailed description explaining why your request was denied, and</li><li>The specific reasons for the denial</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is true for all mortgages, whether federally-backed or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the explanation says your request has errors or is missing information, you have 21 days to correct these issues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you requested forbearance, your lender cannot begin foreclosing on your home or property until they:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Contact you to request payment</li><li>Wait at least 30 days after contacting you to request payment</li><li>File a declaration that they have contacted you to request payment</li><li>File the forbearance denial notice</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can contest either the 30-day contact or the forbearance denial notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you believe your lender harmed you by violating the law, you can file a lawsuit against them. You can get free or low-cost <a href=\"https://housing.ca.gov/resources/tenant.html\">legal help</a> from statewide and local organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find more information:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://housing.ca.gov/pdf/resources/landlord/tenant_fact_sheet_updates_eng.pdf\">Fact sheet on mortgage forbearance</a></li><li><a href=\"https://housing.ca.gov/homeowners/protection_guidelines.html\">Homeowner and landlord protection guidelines</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hcc/hcs.cfm?webListAction=search&amp;searchstate=CA\">Contact a local agency</a> to get free help to avoid foreclosure.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"stimulus-payments\">Stimulus payments</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Golden State Stimulus (GSS) is a one-time $600 or $1,200 payment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be eligible for the GSS if you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Receive the <a href=\"https://www.ftb.ca.gov/about-ftb/newsroom/caleitc/index.html\">California Earned Income Tax Credit (CalEITC)</a>, or</li><li>File tax returns with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) and make $75,000 or less</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ftb.ca.gov/about-ftb/newsroom/golden-state-stimulus/index.html#Check-if-you-qualify-for-the-Golden-State-Stimulus\">Check if you qualify for the GSS</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make sure you receive the GSS, <strong>file your 2020 tax return by October 15, 2021</strong>.
