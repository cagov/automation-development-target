It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to build protection (immunity) against the virus. That means it is possible a person could still get COVID-19 just after vaccination, because the vaccine has not had enough time to build immunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the vaccine you got requires two shots, be sure to get both doses so it can work fully.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"Vaccine-safety\">Vaccine safety&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA have been shown to be <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained\">safe</a> and <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines\">effective</a> in clinical trials.

By getting our 12 to 15-year-olds vaccinated, families can be safer as we get back to doing the things we love.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">My child has had reactions to other vaccines – should they still get the vaccine?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Yes, unless they have had anaphylactic type reactions to components of the Pfizer vaccine.<strong> </strong>Allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine are rare and very few people have had severe adverse reactions. If your child has allergic reactions to the flu vaccine or other severe allergies, you should report that to their health providers in advance of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and important to receive in order to overcome this pandemic. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Is there an increased vaccination risk to children who have pre-existing conditions like asthma?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Youth aged 12 to 15 can still receive the COVID-19 vaccine even if they have underlying health conditions. If you have specific questions about a condition, please talk to your healthcare provider, local community clinic, or public health office.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Will my child be required to get vaccinated before returning to in-person schooling, especially in the fall?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">While vaccination isn’t currently required to return to in-person learning, the state’s objective is to get as many of our 2.1 million 12 to 15-year-olds vaccinated prior to the new fall term. By getting our young people vaccinated soon, we can take comfort in knowing those over age 12 are protected against highly contagious coronavirus variants and COVID-19, both inside and outside of the classroom.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Will my child be required to get vaccinated before they can play recreational or school sports? What about returning to the band or theater or rejoining clubs?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">While vaccination isn’t currently required to play sports, this is the time for our youth to join their teammates and friends in getting vaccinated so they can protect themselves and each other against COVID-19. The state’s industry guidance provides guidelines to support a safe environment for <a href=\"https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#youthsports-guidance\">youth sports activities</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">The resumption of other group activities such as band, theater, and clubs will be coordinated by schools in concert with future state guidelines. Meanwhile, getting our young people vaccinated when they are eligible can help them return to the things they love sooner.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Why is the vaccine only for adolescents 12 and over? When do you expect vaccines to be available for younger children?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Vaccine trials and approvals commonly begin with older, more vulnerable populations then extend to younger ages. Adolescents were the next group to be prioritized because they are most similar to adults and are more likely than younger kids to spread the virus and become seriously ill. This approach balances the need for safety and speed, while protecting our children throughout vaccine development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Both Pfizer and Moderna have ongoing clinical trials in people younger than 12. Depending on the outcome of those trials, authorization for this next age group could happen later this year. Johnson &amp; Johnson is currently in clinical trials for the 12-17 age group.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"Vaccines-allocation-and-distribution\">Vaccines allocation and distribution</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">How are vaccines allocated and distributed?&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Once a week, the federal government announces anticipated allocation figures for each state. The number of allocated doses provided by the federal government is a projection and subject to change. Using the federal allocation as a starting point, the state considers recommendations from the leadership of local health jurisdictions and the state’s Third-Party Administrator (TPA), Blue Shield of California, to make decisions about how best to allocate vaccine supply in the state for efficient and equitable delivery of vaccinations. See the <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/profile/ca.open.data#!/vizhome/COVID-19VaccineAllocationbyLHJ/AllocationbyCounty\">most recent allocation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">The California COVID-19 Vaccination Program obtains data from providers which includes details about their capacity. The TPA combines this data with information solicited from the Local Health Department (LHD) to produce an allocation recommendation to the State. The State makes the final determinations for allocation that are sent directly to the provider at the site level, based on the provider&#8217;s capacity for a two-week period.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">See <a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Feziz.org%2Fassets%2Fdocs%2FCOVID19%2FVax58ProviderFAQs.pdf&amp;data=04%7C01%7CMarta.Green%40calpers.ca.gov%7Cd69f8bb0ade14849a1c508d90992b883%7Cbeec1a79666c427b859c00febbe93470%7C0%7C0%7C637551348034207888%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=1Sl4NLf1VCB8DpzWuzjZSjVH5sjt%2BLt4RHi6MYDoEkk%3D&amp;reserved=0\">California COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider FAQs</a> for complete details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">How can I sign-up to be a COVID-19 vaccine provider?

However, if you can’t get it at the recommended interval, second doses may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There is limited data on how well these vaccines work beyond this window. But if the second dose is given after 42 days, there is no need to start over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Be sure to get the same vaccine the second time that you got the first time. COVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable with each other. The safety and efficacy of mixing vaccines has not been tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Nothing.

Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Yes. We do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Can I get vaccinated against COVID-19 while I am currently sick with COVID-19?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">No. People with COVID-19 who have symptoms should wait to be vaccinated until they have recovered from their illness and have met the <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html\">criteria</a> for ending isolation. Those without symptoms should also wait until they <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html\">meet the criteria</a> before getting vaccinated. This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 before getting their second dose of vaccine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Will COVID-19 vaccine sites be accessible?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Yes.
