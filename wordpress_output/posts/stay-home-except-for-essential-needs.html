<p class="emphasized">California is moving Beyond the Blueprint and safely, fully reopening the economy on June 15 – no more physical distancing, no more capacity limits on businesses, no more county tiers, and relaxed mask guidance.</p>

<p>As of June 15, 2021, the Governor is terminating the executive orders that put into place the <strong>Stay Home Order</strong> and the <strong>Blueprint for a Safer Economy</strong>. He is also phasing out the vast majority of executive actions put in place since March 2020 as part of the pandemic response, leaving in place a subset of provisions that facilitate the ongoing recovery.</p>
