<h3 id="stay-home-order">Stay Home Order</h3>

<p>On March 19, 2020, an <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf">Executive Order</a> and a <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Health%20Order%203.19.2020.pdf">Public Health Order</a> directed all Californians to stay home except to go to an essential job or to shop for essential needs. These orders were modified by the Blueprint for a Safer Economy.</p>

<h3 id="blueprint">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</h3>

<p>On August 28, 2020, the State released the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a> to permit gradual reopening of certain businesses and activities. Counties are assigned tiers that are updated weekly and determined by the county’s case rate and test positivity rate. Local jurisdictions may have more restrictive local orders than the assigned tier.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can the Stay Home Order be changed?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. The State Public Health Officer may issue new orders as the public health situation changes.</p>

<h3 id="blueprint-qas">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</h3>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What&#8217;s open in my county?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can check the open or closed status of more than 100 kinds of businesses or activities at the <a title="check our Blueprint for a Safer Economy page" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Where can I see a map of California&#8217;s counties with their tier levels?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">The Blueprint for a Safer Economy has a <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/#county-status">map of California</a> with each county&#8217;s current tier status: Widespread (purple), Substantial (red), Moderate (orange), or Minimal (yellow).</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get a haircut?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Hair salons and barbershops can open in every county, with modifications for safety. See <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">what’s open in your area</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Are playgrounds open?&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Playgrounds may remain open to facilitate physically distanced personal health and wellness through outdoor exercise.&nbsp;Playgrounds located at schools that remain open for in-person instruction, and not accessible by the general public, may remain open and must follow&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Consolidated_Schools_Guidance.pdf" target="_blank">guidance for schools and school-based programs</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are swimming pools open?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Outdoor swimming pools are allowed to open in all counties in California. Outdoor pools must close slides, rides, or other attractions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Indoor swimming pools are closed in counties in the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">Widespread (purple) or Substantial (red) tiers</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Drowning prevention classes, including swim lessons with certified instructors, are permitted in indoor and outdoor swimming pools in all tiers, as they are deemed essential.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Water parks, both indoor and outdoor, remain closed throughout the state.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">When out of the water, masks or face coverings should be worn. Physical distancing should be practiced at all times. Group gatherings are not allowed. Bring your own towel, and don&#8217;t share items that are worn on the face (like goggles, nose clips, or snorkels). Pool operators should follow heightened cleaning and safety guidance in response to COVID-19. See sector guidance for <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-fitness--en.pdf">gyms and fitness centers</a> and <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-campgrounds-outdoor-recreation--en.pdf">campgrounds and outdoor recreation</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is it safe to shop at open businesses?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">The risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal. That is why every business permitted to open should take every step humanly possible to reduce the risk of infection by following these <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#top">state guidelines</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What is considered an essential business?&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Essential workforce and critical infrastructure sectors are defined on the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/essential-workforce/">Essential workforce</a> web page.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I am not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker, can I still leave the house?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. As described in more detail elsewhere in applicable state public health directives (including on this page), there are a wide range of circumstances in which you may leave your home or other place of residence, even if you are not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker. For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other entity that is allowed to open, to engage in in-person worship and protest activities consistent with public health directives, to patronize local businesses, or to care for friends or family members who require assistance. And errands like these are not the only reasons you may leave your home: you may also leave your home with or without a specific destination in mind (for example, to walk your dog, to engage in physical recreation, or simply to get some fresh air) as long as you maintain physical distancing and comply with any other applicable public health directives.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are safety protocols being enforced? How do I report a business that isn&#8217;t complying?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">They are being enforced, and you can report it. Report unsafe conditions or businesses that shouldn’t be open to your local Alcohol Beverage Control, Labor Commissioner’s office, or regional Cal/OSHA office, depending on the type of business. To find these local contacts, see Appendix B of the <a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/employer-playbook-for-safe-reopening--en.pdf">Employer Playbook for a Safe Reopening</a>.</p>

<div class="wp-accordion-content"><!-- Adding keywords mask masks report reporting enforce enforcement compliance for quick answers purposes --></div>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I walk my dog? Take my pet to the vet?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can walk your dog. You can go to the vet or pet hospital if your pet is sick. Remember to wear a face covering and distance yourself at least 6 feet from other pets and owners.</p>

<h3 id="political">Protected activities</h3>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">I want to express my political views.&nbsp; How can I make my voice heard without raising public health concerns?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">There are many ways for you to express your political views without holding a physical, in-person gathering.&nbsp; For example, you may continue to call or write elected officials, write letters to the editor of news publications, display lawn or window signs, or use online and other electronic media (including Zoom rooms, Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, and other digital forums) to express your views.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Additionally, as noted above, you may leave your home for any reason as long as you comply with any other applicable public health directives. When you are otherwise out in public, public health directives do not prevent you from engaging in political expression—such as by wearing or carrying a sign.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">If collective action in physical space is important to you, consider whether you and other participants can safely protest from within your cars.&nbsp;The State Public Health Officer does not consider in-car activities to be gatherings, if participants stay in their cars and otherwise remain apart from individuals who are not part of their households.&nbsp;Many activists have organized car-based protests (honking horns, flying flags, displaying signs, and so on) to express their political views while complying with State public health directives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Whenever you are considering a protest (including an in-car protest), make sure you comply with all other applicable laws, including any local public-health measures that may be more restrictive than statewide directives and any other applicable local laws.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you do wish to engage in in-person protest outside of your car with a group of any size, you must follow the guidelines for political protest gatherings below.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I engage in political rallies and protest gatherings?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, although in-person protests and rallies present special public health concerns&nbsp;for high risk of COVID-19 transmission.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Even with adherence to physical distancing, bringing members of different households together to engage in in-person protests and rallies carries an especially high risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19. &nbsp;Such gatherings may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like chanting, shouting, singing, and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through 6 feet of physical distancing. For this reason, people engaging in these activities must wear face coverings at all times. </p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Therefore, it is strongly recommended that those exercising their right to engage in political expression (including, for example, their right to petition the government) should utilize alternative channels, such as the many online and broadcasting platforms available in the digital age, in place of in-person gatherings.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">However, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person <em>outdoor</em> protests and rallies as long as you maintain a physical distance of at least 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households at all times. In addition, you must wear a face covering or mask. Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction&#8217;s key COVID-19 health indicators. Failure to follow these requirements may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">In-person&nbsp;<em>indoor </em>protests and rallies are permitted as long as&nbsp;(1) attendance is limited to 25% capacity in Widespread (purple) and Substantial (red) tiers and 50% capacity in Moderate (orange) and Minimal (yellow) tiers, and (2)&nbsp;physical distancing of at least 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times. Singing and chanting activities significantly increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission and are strongly discouraged.&nbsp;Failure to follow these requirements may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action.&nbsp;Masks and face coverings are required in compliance with CDPH directives.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Participants must maintain a physical distance of at least 6 feet from any uniformed peace officers and other public safety personnel present, unless otherwise directed, and follow all other requirements and directives imposed by local health officers and law enforcement, or other applicable authorities.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">This limitation on attendance will be reviewed regularly. This review will assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of gatherings that implicate the First Amendment.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion" id="vote">How do I vote?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Elections are an <a href="http://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/CDPH-to-SOS-Letter-from-Acting-HO-Aug-18-1.pdf">essential activity</a>, and applicable provisions of the Elections Code continue to govern elections during COVID-19 unless suspended or amended. Specific legislation has been enacted to address the administration of elections during COVID-19. Pursuant to this legislation, measures like vote by mail, early voting locations, and ballot drop boxes have been used to ensure that California’s elections are safe, secure, and accessible. Find <a href="https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ccrov/pdf/2020/july/20154jl.pdf">guidance for the safe administration of elections</a> during COVID-19.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Visit <a class="external" href="https://registertovote.ca.gov/">online voter registration</a> to register to vote or check your voter registration status.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Practice physical distancing and follow other applicable public health directives while engaged in election-related activities. These include collection and drop-off of ballots, and collection of signatures to qualify candidates or measures for the ballot.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I go to church?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Places of worship such as churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues can open throughout the state, with <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#worship">modifications for safety</a>. In counties in the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">Widespread (purple) tier</a>, indoor services in places of worship are now recommended to open at 25% of room’s usual capacity, but outdoor services, remote services, and other alternatives to in-person religious practice are strongly recommended. In the Substantial (red) tier, indoor services in places of worship are recommended to operate at 25% of room’s usual capacity. In counties in the Moderate (orange) and Minimal (yellow) tier, indoor services are recommended to operate at 50% capacity.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I practice my religious faith?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Practicing your faith is a constitutionally-protected activity and may manifest in many different forms.<!-- church, mosque, synagogue, temple, wedding, funeral, baptism --></p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Although in-person religious gatherings—like other in-person gatherings—pose a high risk of transmission of COVID-19, in light of recent judicial rulings, the State has lifted its location and capacity limits on in-person religious gatherings. All other restrictions remain in place.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What conditions must be met to resume religious services and cultural ceremonies at places of worship?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Information on conditions imposed by the state can be found at <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#worship">guidance for places of worship</a>. Additional conditions may be imposed by local public health officials. This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activity. It is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services and other alternatives to in-person religious practice for those who are vulnerable to COVID19.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Even with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple households to practice a personal faith carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like singing and group recitation dramatically increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For this reason, singing and chanting activities are strongly discouraged and should be undertaken with the modifications specified by the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-for-the-Prevention-of-COVID-19-Transmission-for-Gatherings-November-2020.aspx">gatherings guidance</a>. Congregants engaging in group recitation should wear face coverings at all times.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Places of worship may open indoor operations and are recommended to do so observing capacity limits as noted in the <a title="See the requirements at Blueprint for a Safer Economy" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a> and complying with all safety modifications and guidance requirements, when permitted by relevant local restrictions.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on&nbsp;<em>outdoor&nbsp;</em>attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction&#8217;s key COVID-19 health indicators. At a minimum, outdoor attendance should be limited naturally through implementation of strict physical distancing measures of a minimum of 6 feet between attendees from different households, in addition to other relevant protocols within this document. </p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">This limitation will be regularly reviewed by the California Department of Public Health.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can children attend group activities (like Sunday school or Hebrew school) at places of worship?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes.&nbsp; Outdoor activities are permitted in all tiers. In the Widespread (purple) tier, indoor activities are permitted if they comply with the <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/small-groups-child-youth.aspx">cohort guidance</a>. In all other tiers, indoor activities should follow the guidance applicable to Day Camps.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">When will current conditions change for places of worship?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">The California Department of Public Health, in consultation with county Departments of Public Health, will regularly review and assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of activities in places of worship. </p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are weddings allowed?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Wedding ceremonies should follow the guidance for <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#worship">Places of worship or cultural ceremonies</a>. As required by that guidance, social distancing should be practiced by all attendees. Wear masks, wash hands frequently, and keep 6 feet from anyone you don’t live with.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Indoor ceremonies are strongly discouraged, especially in the Widespread (purple) and Substantial (red) tiers due to high risk of transmission indoors. To check what’s recommended under your county’s tier status, look up “Weddings” in the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Ceremonies should not allow for food or beverage for the guests, especially indoors.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Wedding receptions are permitted, but also have restrictions on their capacity and setting based on your county’s tier status. For current conditions, look up “Receptions” in the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">While wedding receptions are currently permitted,&nbsp;consider safer options like sharing your wedding online via video conference (Zoom, Google Meet, or other platforms). This protects all your loved ones, especially those at high risk like seniors or people with chronic conditions. </p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">See more details in guidance for <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#worship">Places of worship and cultural ceremonies</a> and guidance for <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#private-events">Private venues and events</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are gatherings for musical, theatrical, and artistic performances permitted?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Gatherings for live musical, theatrical, and other artistic performances are permitted consistent with the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#live-performances">guidance for seated live audience events</a> or with the applicable sector guidance for the venue hosting such a performance (such as <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#restaurants">restaurants, wineries, or bars</a>). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I go to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, but first check if you can <a class="external" href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv-online/">complete your transaction online</a>. Nearly all Californians can now renew their driver’s license online – even if the renewal notice states an office visit is required. Customers can also use the <a class="external" href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/make-an-appointment/service-advisor/">Service Advisor</a> on the DMV website to learn their options to complete DMV tasks.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">To protect customers and employees, the DMV requires everyone who enters DMV offices to wear a face covering, physically distance, respond to health screening questions, and have their temperature checked. To best serve customers and maintain appropriate distance, the number of people allowed in the office is limited, chairs are appropriately spaced, and plexiglass has been installed.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Safety measures in place for behind-the-wheel tests include required face coverings, responding to health screening questions, temperature checks, cracked windows for increased air circulation, and seat covers.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get my car smog checked?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends. Some smog check locations may be closed. The <a class="external" href="https://www.bar.ca.gov/COVID-19_Impacts_on_BAR_Programs_and_Services.aspx">Bureau of Automotive Repair</a> advises drivers to still pay DMV vehicle registration fees to avoid any late fees. However, you will not receive your new registration or year sticker until the smog information has been received by DMV. Once state and local orders or directives are no longer in effect, you can then obtain the required smog check certificate to complete the DMV vehicle registration process.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Who can I reach out to regarding my child custody order and child visitation rights?&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Court operations vary from county to county.

<h3 id="past-orders">Past orders</h3>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What was the Regional Stay Home Order?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.3.20-Stay-at-Home-Order-ICU-Scenario.pdf">Regional Stay Home Order</a>, announced December 3, 2020, triggered additional restrictions after a region was announced to have less than 15% ICU availability. It prohibited private gatherings of any size, closed sector operations except for critical infrastructure and retail, and required 100% masking (with certain exceptions as indicated in <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">guidance for use of face coverings</a>) and physical distancing.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">The Regional Stay Home Order was lifted January 25, 2021 as projected ICU availability over 4 weeks in all regions rose to over 15%. Once a region exited the Regional Stay Home Order, counties within that region returned to the appropriate tier and rules under the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Why was the Regional Stay Home Order put into place?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">The Regional Stay Home Order was put into place to address a crisis in ICU capacity that was caused by unprecedented exponential community transmission combined with scarce hospital resources in equipment, space, and staffing. Regions entered the Regional Stay Home Order when the regional ICU capacity fell below 15%. Four out of five of California’s regions were at some time subject to the Regional Stay Home Order. The State’s overall ICU capacity fell to 0% in December, pointing to the statewide nature of the crisis. The Regional Stay Home Order was necessary to avoid a collapse of hospital capacity and the need to transition to crisis standards of care, which could result in rationing of access to ventilators and other lifesaving treatment and&nbsp; scores of unnecessary deaths.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Regions exited the Regional Stay Home Order when their projected four-week ICU capacity rose above 15%. ICU capacity is projected four weeks out because ICU capacity is a lagging indicator; even if ICU capacity is below 15% today, those hospitalizations are results of infections that were weeks ago, not because of current transmission rates. Projected ICU capacity is based on four factors: current estimated regional ICU capacity available, measure of current community transmission, current regional case rates, and the proportion of cases being admitted to the ICU.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is the Regional Stay at Home Order still in effect?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. All four Regions that were subject to the Regional Stay Home Order have exited because their projected four-week ICU capacity is above 15%. The Sacramento Region exited on January 12 with a projected four-week ICU capacity of 19.1%. The Bay Area Region exited on January 25 with a projected four-week ICU capacity of 25.0%. The Southern California Region exited on January 25 with a projected four-week ICU capacity of 33.3%.The San Joaquin Valley Region exited on January 25 with a projected four-week ICU capacity of 22.3%. The Northern California Region never fell below 15% in ICU capacity and was at 47.9% on January 25.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">These metrics, along with declining cases, hospitalizations, test positivity and transmission rates across the State, demonstrate that the Regional Stay Home Order had its intended effect of interrupting the exponential rate of community transmission that threatened to overwhelm our healthcare delivery system. While COVID-19 remains prevalent and dangerous, with cases still well above our summer surge, the crisis experienced at the end of 2020 has subsided and the additional restrictions imposed beyond those applicable under the Blueprint for a Safer Economy can be rescinded.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Why was the Regional Stay Home Order ended?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">This order ended for all regions statewide on January 25, 2021 because 4-week ICU capacity projections in the three remaining regions under the order had reached 15% or higher. The Limited Stay at Home Order (curfew) also ended. Counties returned to restrictions according to their tier in the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/" title="open Blueprint for a Safer Economy page">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do we know we won’t shut down again? What happens if ICUs are overwhelmed again?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">We ended the Regional Stay Home Order and hope we do not need to resort to such strict measures to keep our health care system protected and to save lives. We will examine conditions moving forward and determine interventions as they are warranted. The State will continue to take public health measures necessary to protect vulnerable Californians and the health care delivery system. With everyone’s continued collaboration, we hope to continue on the path to reopening.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What did ending the Regional Stay Home Order mean for school reopening?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">This did not change the framework around school reopening. See <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Consolidated_Schools_Guidance.pdf">COVID-19 and Reopening In-Person Instruction Framework &amp; Public Health Guidance for K-12 Schools in California, 2020-2021 School Year</a>. Schools that are already open can remain open. Schools that are not already open must follow the reopening criteria laid out in that guidance.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What was the Limited Stay Home Order?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/limited-stay-at-home-order-qa.aspx">Limited Stay Home Order</a> (effective November 21, 2020) and its <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Supplement-to-Limited-Stay-At-Home-Order.aspx">Supplement</a> (effective December 22, 2020) required that in counties in the Widespread (purple) tier, Californians stay home between 10:00pm and 5:00am, with some exceptions.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">This order was ended January 25, 2021 and is no longer in effect.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What was the May 4, 2020 modification to the Stay Home Order?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">On May 4, 2020, the Stay Home Order was first <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.4.20-EO-N-60-20.pdf">modified</a> to allow gradual reopening. This order was replaced by the Blueprint for a Safer Economy on August 28, 2020.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What was the Hospital Surge Order?</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Counties with 10% ICU availability or less, in regions with 0% ICU availability, were directed to prioritize services to those who were sickest and to cancel or reschedule elective surgeries. This was per the <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/State-Public-Health-Officer-Order-Revoking-the-Hospital-Surge-Order.aspx">Hospital Surge Public Health Order</a>, updated January 15, 2021.</p>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">This order was ended February 5, 2021 and is no longer in effect.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I find out what the hospital/ICU capacity is in my region or county?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">The state maintains a publicly-available dashboard on <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/state-dashboard/">hospital and ICU capacity by county</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will the state open up alternative care facilities or surge hospitals in the hardest-hit regions to reduce stress on hospitals?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Currently the state has 11 alternative care sites that could be activated in 24-96 hours should they be needed. The total number of beds in these alternative care sites is 1,862.&nbsp;In addition to the alternative care sites the state has 22 California Medical Stations, which are 50 bed field hospitals, in our cache that can be rapidly deployed. In total we have a capacity of approximately 3,000 additional medical beds currently available beyond what we have in the hospital system. Information on the number of alternative care sites and the number of surge beds in use can be found at the <a class="external" href="https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19BedSurgeDashboard/BedSurge?:embed=y&amp;:showVizHome=no">Alternate Care Site Dashboard</a>.</p>
