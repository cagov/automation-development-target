<h2>What&#8217;s considered essential travel</h2>



<p>Some travel is considered essential and necessary. &#8220;Essential travel&#8221; is travel associated with the operation, maintenance, or usage of critical infrastructure or otherwise required or expressly authorized by law (including other applicable state and local public health directives), including:</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="why-travel-is-risky"/>



<h2>Why travel increases risk</h2>



<p>When you travel, you spend more time outside your home and come into contact with people outside your household. You are near new people in airports, train stations, gas stations, grocery stores, restaurants, hotels, short-term rentals, sightseeing attractions, and retail stores. These new people may be exposing you to COVID-19, or you may be unknowingly exposing them. </p>



<p>People arriving from other states or Californians returning from other states or countries could also introduce new strains of the coronavirus to California, which leads to more illness and death.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Postpone non-essential travel until you are fully vaccinated to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.</p>

<h2>Questions and answers</h2>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">Are there travel restrictions within California?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">On April 1, 2021, the California Department of Public Health issued a revised <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx">Travel Advisory</a> that supersedes the previous Travel Advisory issued on January 6, 2021. This advisory affects all counties in California.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">To prevent further spread of COVID-19 and help contain any new sources of infection, unvaccinated Californians should delay travel, unless they are traveling for essential purposes. Essential travel includes: work and study, critical infrastructure support, economic services and supply chains, health, immediate medical care, and safety and security.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Traveling into California from other states or countries for tourism or recreation is strongly discouraged. Anyone traveling into California who is not fully vaccinated should get tested before and after travel, and self-quarantine for 7 days if they have a negative COVID test result. If they weren’t tested, they should self-quarantine for 10 days. See the California Department of Public Health’s <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx">Travel Advisory</a> for more info.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Do I need to self-quarantine when I arrive in California?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Traveling into California for tourism or recreation is strongly discouraged.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you do travel into California, and are not fully vaccinated, you should get tested before and after. <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/CDPH-Home-Quarantine-Guidance_9-16-2020.pdf">Self-quarantine</a> for 10 days after you arrive, or 7 days if you have a negative COVID-19 test result. Limit your interactions to people in your household. If you are traveling into California for essential purposes, you should still self-quarantine and ensure you do not mix with others outside of those necessary to conduct your essential work. </p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion">Can I visit State Parks? What outdoor spaces are open?</h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Outdoor spaces, including state parks, may be open to facilitate physically distanced personal health and wellness through outdoor exercise. However, be sure to check the status of parks in your area before you travel as some State Parks may continue to be closed to help slow the spread of the virus.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">For information on National Parks, please the <a class="external" href="https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/news/public-health-update.htm">National Park Service website</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Californians should delay recreational travel if they are unvaccinated. If you do travel, wear a mask, keep 6 feet of distance from those not in your household, and wash your hands frequently. Get tested before and after travel, and even if you have a negative COVID test result, self-quarantine for 7 days after travel. If you weren’t tested, self-quarantine for 10 days.</p>
