<li>If you’re not fully vaccinated, but choose to travel, get tested before and after</li>
<li>No matter your vaccination status, wear a mask <strong>indoors</strong> while on public transportation or in a transportation hub</li>
<li>Wearing a mask <strong>outdoors</strong> while traveling is no longer required, but still recommended for unvaccinated individuals</li>
