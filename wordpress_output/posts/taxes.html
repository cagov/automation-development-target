<h2 id="individual-taxes">Golden State Stimulus</h2>

<p>The Golden State Stimulus (GSS) is a $600, one-time relief payment. You’ll get it if you receive the California Earned Income Tax Credit after claiming it on your 2020 individual tax return, which is filed this year.</p>

<p>You’ll get an additional $600, one-time GSS payment if you file your return with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN).</p>

<p>ITIN filers who do not receive the California Earned Income Tax Credit but earn $75,000 or less will get a $600 GSS payment.</p>
