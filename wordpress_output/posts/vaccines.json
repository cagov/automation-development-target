It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to build protection (immunity) against the virus. That means it is possible you could still get COVID-19 just after vaccination, because your body has not had enough time to build immunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What we know</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>COVID-19</strong> <strong>vaccinations can prevent nearly all COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Post-Vaccine-COVID19-Cases.aspx\">Post-vaccination cases</a> are extremely rare.</li><li><strong>They reduce the spread of COVID-19</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>What we’re still learning</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>How effective the vaccines are against </strong><a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-Variants.aspx\"><strong>variants</strong></a> of the virus that causes COVID-19.

These are normal signs that your body is building immunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You may have soreness, redness, or swelling where you got your shot.&nbsp;</li><li>You may be tired or have a headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, or nausea. &nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Side effects may affect your ability to do daily activities, but should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects.

There are other COVID-19 vaccines where this risk has not been seen. Read CDPH’s <a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/JnJ_factsheet.pdf\">Fact Sheet: Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine Benefits and Risks</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Myocarditis and pericarditis</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The CDC has received reports of myocarditis and pericarditis in adolescents and young adults after vaccination with Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. The CDC confirms that known and potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks, including the possible risk of myocarditis or pericarditis. We continue to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for anyone 12 years of age and older.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reporting side effects of vaccines</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have experienced a side effect after COVID-19 vaccination, you can report it to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html\">VAERS</a> (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System)</li><li><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html\">V-safe</a> (After Vaccination Health Checker)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"When to call the doctor\" id=\"When-to-call-the-doctor\">When to call the doctor</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, discomfort from pain or fever is a normal sign that your body is building protection.

Before vaccinating a minor, vaccine providers must obtain consent from a:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-accordion-content\"><li>Parent,&nbsp;</li><li>Legal guardian, or&nbsp;</li><li>Other adults having legal custody..&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">There are some exceptions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-accordion-content\"><li><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=FAM&amp;sectionNum=7050.\">Emancipated minors</a> do not need the consent of a parent or guardian to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>Providers may accept written consent from a parent or legal guardian of an unaccompanied minor.&nbsp;The written consent must verify the parent/guardian has been provided the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download\">Pfizer EUA Fact Sheet</a>.</li><li>Phone or video consent is acceptable, provided the parent/guardian confirms that they received the<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download\"> Pfizer EUA Fact Sheet</a>. Reading the Fact Sheet to the parent/guardian is an option.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Families should check with their vaccine provider on acceptable forms of consent. See CDPH’s <a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Pfizer-Vaccine-Minor-Consent-Guidance.aspx\">Pfizer Vaccine Minor Consent Guidance</a> for more details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Why should I vaccinate my child?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Cases in children are increasing. The <a href=\"https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP%20and%20CHA%20-%20Children%20and%20COVID-19%20State%20Data%20Report%204.29.21%20FINAL.pdf\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> reports that youth now account for 22% of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. This time last year it was only around 3%. It is important to get young people vaccinated to prevent new cases from increasing further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Vaccinations may stop the spread of coronavirus variants and shrink the pool of people vulnerable to COVID-19. By getting our 12- to 15-year-olds vaccinated, families can be safer as we get back to doing the things we love.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">My child has had reactions to other vaccines – should they still get the vaccine?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Yes, unless they have had anaphylactic-type reactions to components of the Pfizer vaccine.<strong> </strong>Allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine are rare and very few people have had severe adverse reactions. If your child has allergic reactions to the flu vaccine or other severe allergies, you should report that to their health providers before they receive the COVID-19 vaccine. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Is there an increased vaccination risk to children who have pre-existing conditions like asthma?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Youth aged 12 to 15 can still receive the COVID-19 vaccine even if they have underlying health conditions. If you have specific questions about a condition, please talk to your healthcare provider or local community clinic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Will my child be required to get vaccinated before returning to in-person schooling, especially in the fall?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">No. Vaccination isn’t currently required to return to in-person learning. But the state’s objective is to get as many of our 2.1 million 12- to 15-year-olds vaccinated prior to the new fall term. Vaccination will protect young people against highly contagious coronavirus variants and COVID-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Why is the vaccine only for adolescents 12 and over? When do you expect vaccines to be available for younger children?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Vaccine trials commonly begin with older, more vulnerable populations then extend to younger ages. Adolescents were the next group to be prioritized because they are most similar to adults. Also, they are more likely than younger kids to spread the virus and become seriously ill. This approach balances the need for safety and speed, while protecting our children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Both Pfizer and Moderna have ongoing clinical trials in people younger than 12. Depending on the outcome of those trials, authorization for this next age group could happen later this year. Johnson &amp; Johnson is currently in clinical trials for the 12-17 age group.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"Vaccines-allocation-and-distribution\">Vaccines allocation and distribution</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">I&#8217;m an employer and want to help my employees get vaccinated.

Can I get my second vaccine shot at a different interval than recommended? Can I mix and match COVID-19 vaccines from different manufacturers?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Ideally, you’d get:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-accordion-content\"><li>Two doses for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 21 days apart</li><li>Two doses for the Moderna vaccine, 28 days apart&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">The Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen vaccine only requires one dose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">If two shots are required, <strong><strong>get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible</strong></strong>,<strong> </strong>but not sooner. However, if you can’t get it at the recommended interval, second doses may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There is limited data on how well these vaccines work beyond this window. But if the second dose is given after 42 days, there is no need to start over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">You can’t mix and match different vaccines. Be sure to get the same vaccine the second time that you got the first time. COVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable with each other. The safety and efficacy of mixing vaccines has not been tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Nothing. COVID-19 vaccines, including their administration, are free to the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Read more at the Department of Managed Health Care’s <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/VaccineFactSheetAccessible.pdf\">Know Your Health Care Rights</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Do I need to be a California resident to get COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">No. Vaccine distribution is based on eligibility irrespective of residency or immigration status.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">How do I cancel or reschedule my vaccine appointment through My Turn?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">If you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment, you can do so on your phone or computer, using the text or email notification you received after booking.<br><br>On your phone, click the &#8220;QR Code link&#8221; in your text appointment confirmation. This will take you to a web page that contains your QR code and a link to the &#8220;<a href=\"https://myturn.ca.gov/manage\">Manage your appointments</a>&#8221; page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">On your computer, click the &#8220;Manage your appointment(s) here&#8221; link in the email appointment confirmation you received from My Turn. The &#8220;<a href=\"https://myturn.ca.gov/manage\">Manage your appointments</a>&#8221; page will open and you will be asked to confirm your appointment with:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-accordion-content\"><li>Your appointment confirmation number, and&nbsp;</li><li>Either your cell phone number or your email address.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">After confirming, you will have the choice to cancel or reschedule your appointment(s).</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">I’ve already had COVID-19. Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Yes. We do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Can I get vaccinated against COVID-19 while I am currently sick with COVID-19?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">No. People with COVID-19 should wait to be vaccinated until they have recovered from their illness and have met the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html\">criteria</a> for ending isolation. This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 before getting their second dose of vaccine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Will COVID-19 vaccine sites be accessible?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Yes. All vaccine clinics in California are required to ensure sites and services are accessible in accordance with ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">How do I get a COVID-19 vaccine at home, if I am unable to travel to a vaccine site?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Check with your healthcare provider, local health department, or local pharmacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">If you cannot leave your home to get vaccinated, you can indicate this on <a href=\"http://cert1.mail-west.com/rUyeH/mc7rm/myuzjan/rUgt/dk9o81/erho/nv6ok/51rUaxx\">myturn.ca.gov</a> or when calling the state’s COVID-19 hotline at <a href=\"Tel: 833‑422‑4255\">(833) 422‑4255</a>. If eligible, you will be connected with your local health jurisdiction to arrange for in-home vaccination.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">How do I get transportation to a vaccine site?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">If you do not have a way to get to a vaccination site, you can receive free transportation through:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-accordion-content\"><li><a href=\"http://cert1.mail-west.com/c7rmfWysJ/myuzjanm/fWgt/dk9o81/erho/nv6ok/61fWpjj\">My Turn</a>, or&nbsp;</li><li>By calling the state’s COVID-19 hotline at (833) 422-4255.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Transportation options include automobile transportation for ambulatory patients and non-emergency medical transportation for non-ambulatory patients, including wheelchair vans, gurney transportation, and other options. Medi-Cal managed care and fee-for-service beneficiaries will be connected with their health plan or service provider to get transportation through existing health benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">You can also check with your healthcare provider, local health department, or local pharmacy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">If you receive Medi-Cal through a managed care plan, contact your plan’s member service department to request assistance for transportation to receive covered benefits. If you receive Medi-Cal through Fee-for-Service (FFS), you can access a list of Non-Medical Transportation (NMT) providers in your county and you can contact them directly to arrange transportation to your appointments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">If there is not a provider in your area, the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) can assist if you email them at <a href=\"mailto: DHCSNMT@dhcs.ca.gov\">DHCSNMT@dhcs.ca.gov</a>. Please do NOT include personal information in your first email. DHCS staff will reply with a secure email asking for your information about the appointment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">If you have a need for Non-Emergency Medical Transportation, please inform your medical provider. They can prescribe this service and put you in touch with a transportation provider to coordinate your ride to and from your appointment(s).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"What-to-expect-after-vaccination-QA\">What to expect after vaccination</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">What is acceptable as proof of full vaccination?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">The following are accepted:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-accordion-content\"><li>Original COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card which includes:<ul><li>&nbsp;Name of person vaccinated</li><li>Date of birth&nbsp;</li><li>Type of vaccine provided</li><li>Lot number</li><li>Date last dose administered</li><li>Site where administered</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-accordion-content\"><li>A photo or paper copy of your DHHS CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card</li><li>A photo of your DHHS CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card stored on a phone or other electronic device</li><li>Paper or digital documentation of vaccination from a healthcare provider or other issuer.</li><li>A digital copy of your vaccination record from the <a href=\"https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/\">Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record</a> (DCVR).&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Read CDPH’s <a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Vaccine-Record-Guidelines-Standards.aspx\">Vaccine Record Guidelines &amp; Standards</a> for complete details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">What does it mean to be “fully vaccinated”?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">People are considered fully vaccinated for COVID-19:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-accordion-content\"><li>Two weeks after they receive the second dose in a 2-dose series (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna), or</li><li>&nbsp;Two weeks after they receive a single-dose vaccine (Johnson and Johnson/Janssen).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">See CDPH’s <a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Public-Health-Recommendations-for-Fully-Vaccinated-People.aspx\">COVID-19 Public Health Recommendations for Fully Vaccinated People</a> for details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Will the COVID-19 vaccine make me test positive for COVID-19?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">No. A vaccine will not cause you to test positive on <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html\">viral tests</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">If your body develops an immune response (the goal of vaccination), there is a possibility that you may test positive on <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html\">antibody tests</a>. Antibody tests indicate that you may have protection against the virus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">How is my privacy protected if I take the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">California law strictly limits how personal information about those who are vaccinated can be shared. California negotiated with the federal government to limit the required data sharing to only information that will not allow an individual to be identified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Read more at CDPH’s <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/California-Data-Use-Agreement.aspx\">California Data Use Agreement and Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Should I keep my COVID-19 vaccination record card?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Yes. We urge Californians to keep their vaccination record cards for themselves and their families in a safe place to prevent loss or damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">The <a href=\"https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/\">Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record</a> (DCVR) portal gives you a digital copy of your vaccine record.

COVID-19 vaccine does not provide protection against flu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Are there certain populations who should not get a COVID-19 vaccine? <strong>What about people with allergies?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">The <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html\">CDC recommends</a> that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-accordion-content\"><li>If you have had a severe or immediate allergic reaction to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine.</li><li>If you have had a severe or immediate allergic reaction to any ingredient in the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the Janssen vaccine.</li><li>If you had an immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the second dose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>If you are allergic to PEG, you should not get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Ask your doctor if you can get the Janssen vaccine.</li><li>If you are allergic to polysorbate, you should not get the Janssen vaccine. Ask your doctor if you can get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>If you aren’t able to get one type of COVID-19 vaccine because you are allergic to an ingredient, ask your doctor if you should get a different vaccine.&nbsp;</li><li>If you aren’t able to get the second shot of an mRNA vaccine because you had an allergic reaction, ask your doctor if you should get a different vaccine.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">People with underlying medical conditions can receive the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines provided they have not had <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html\">an immediate or severe allergic reaction</a> to a COVID-19 vaccine or to any of the ingredients in the vaccine.

The CDC states that pregnant and lactating individuals can receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Experts have not identified any safety concerns for vaccinated pregnant or lactating women or their breastfeeding babies. The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain the live virus, so they cannot cause COVID-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Pregnant people are more likely to get severely ill with COVID-19 compared with non-pregnant people. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy can protect you from severe illness if you get COVID-19. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">For more information, read:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-accordion-content\"><li>CDC’s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html\">COVID-19 Vaccines While Pregnant or Breastfeeding</a></li><li>CDPH’s <a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/COVID-19-Vaccine-and-Pregnancy.pdf\">COVID-19 Vaccine and Pregnancy</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">How long should I wait to get the vaccine after I’ve had COVID-19?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">The <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo-by-product%2Fpfizer%2Fclinical-considerations.html\">CDC recommends:</a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-accordion-content\"><li>If you tested positive, had only mild symptoms, and were not treated for the coronavirus, you should:<ul><li>Wait at least 10 days after the start of COVID-19 symptoms, and<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Meet <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html\">criteria</a> to stop isolation before getting the COVID-19 vaccine.</li></ul></li><li>Wait 90 days to get the vaccine if:<ul><li>You recovered from a COVID-19 infection, and&nbsp;</li><li>Were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as another vaccine?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Yes, you can get a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines (like for the flu) at the same visit. You no longer need to wait 14 days between different vaccinations.

Once more and more Californians see how safe and effective the COVID-19 vaccines are, we hope they will voluntarily opt to receive them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">May an employer require COVID-19 vaccination for all employees entering the workplace?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Yes, if certain requirements are met. Under the ADA, an employer may require all employees to meet a qualification standard that is job-related and consistent with business necessity, such as a safety-related standard requiring COVID-19 vaccination. However, if a particular employee cannot meet such a safety-related qualification standard because of a disability, the employer may not require compliance for that employee unless the employer can demonstrate that the individual would pose a “direct threat” to the health or safety of the employee or others in the workplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Read <a href=\"https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-covid-19-and-ada-rehabilitation-act-and-other-eeo-laws\">What You Should Know About COVID-19 and the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Other EEO Laws<strong> </strong></a>for complete details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-accordion\">How can I convince my family and friends to take a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-accordion-content\">Talking with family and friends about the benefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine can be hard.
