<h3>Hotel rooms for healthcare workers</h3>

<p>On June 15, 2021, the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/hotel-rooms-for-california-healthcare-workers/">Hotel rooms for California healthcare workers</a> program was discontinued for all facilities except those located in Riverside, Imperial, and San Diego counties.

<h2 id="workplace-safety-standards">COVID-19 workplace safety standards&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Physical distancing and capacity limits for businesses and activities are over. Guidance for specific industries has ended. But employers are still responsible for maintaining safe environments for employees and customers.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 Prevention Emergency Temporary Standards</h3>

<p>Employers must follow workplace safety and health regulations to protect workers. That includes protecting workers from COVID-19. Follow the COVID-19 Prevention <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">Emergency Temporary Standards</a> (ETS) to keep your workplace safe. </p>

<p>Visit <a href="https://saferatwork.covid19.ca.gov/">Safer At Work</a> to learn more about COVID-19 workplace requirements.</p>

<h3>Returning to work after getting sick or exposed to COVID-19</h3>

<p>Employers must ensure workers meet the criteria in the <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">ETS</a> before they return to work.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>If a worker has </strong><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Symptoms-Risks.aspx#Question1"><strong>symptoms</strong></a>, they must isolate at home until <strong>all</strong> of these are true:</p>

<ul><li>At least 10 days have passed since their symptoms began</li><li>Their fever has been gone for 24 hours without the aid of medication&nbsp;</li><li>Their symptoms have improved</li></ul>

<p><strong>If a worker has no symptoms and:</strong></p>

<ul><li><strong>Are </strong><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Public-Health-Recommendations-for-Fully-Vaccinated-People.aspx"><strong>fully vaccinated</strong></a><strong>,</strong> they can continue to go to work</li><li><strong>Are not vaccinated and:</strong><ul><li><strong>Tested positive,</strong> they must isolate at home for at least 10 days after they first tested positive</li><li><strong>Had </strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact"><strong>close contact</strong></a><strong> with someone who has COVID-19</strong>, they must quarantine at home for at least 10 days since their last exposure to COVID-19</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>A negative test is <strong>not</strong> required to return to work.</p>

<ul><li>Are fully vaccinated</li><li>Are not vaccinated</li><li>Were previously infected</li></ul>

<p>CDPH recommends fully vaccinated people without symptoms get tested 3-5 days after exposure.</p>

<p>CDPH recommends unvaccinated people without symptoms who had close contact:</p>

<ul><li>End their quarantine after Day 7 if they test negative after Day 5 from the date of last exposure</li><li>Not quarantine if it’s been less than 3 months since they previously had COVID-19</li></ul>
