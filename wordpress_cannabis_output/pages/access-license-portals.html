<h2>Questions and answers</h2>

<h3>Why are there three licensing systems?</h3>

<p>The Department of Cannabis Control was created on July 1, 2021, by merging three existing state programs. Each of those former programs had its own online licensing system.</p>

<p>We’re working on creating one licensing system for all businesses. Until then, use the system for the license type you have or are applying for.</p>

<h3>Which system do I use if I want more than one license?</h3>

<p>Use the online licensing system that corresponds to each license you’re seeking. You may need to submit applications through more than one system.</p>
